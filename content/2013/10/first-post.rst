:summary: We started blogging

Welcome to the Earth Reader blog.

Earth Reader is a feed reader intended to be run on various devices and
synchronized without any particular centralized proprietary services.
There also is `Hong Minhee's blog post`__ about our initial motivation of
the project.

This is where we're going to drop all sorts of posts about what is going on
in the Earth Reader project.  We will try to periodically update the blog.

| Thanks,
| Minhee and the Earth Reader team
