Thanks to Heeyeon Jeong, she designed a set of beautiful Earth Reader icons
for iOS, Mac, Windows, Android, and a favicon.  Fresh green sprouts and brown
ground remind us the etymology of Earth Reader; earth doesn't mean the planet
on which we live, but the land surface.  We actually tried to find an
adversative to *cloud*.

Visit her Dribbble__ as well if you're interested.
