Hi,

We are pleased to announce the release of libearth 0.3.0 and 0.2.1.
Libearth is the shared common library for Earth Reader apps.
Libearth 0.3.0 is the third minor release of libearth.
There have been several architectural improvements e.g. richer crawl results,
deletion detection on merge, and a lot of parser bugs.
You can find the full changelog:
